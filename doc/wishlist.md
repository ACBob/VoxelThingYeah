These are wishes I have for the engine to support:

 - [ ] Modding
     - [ ] Scripting API (Lua AND AngelScript)
         - [ ] Filesystem Interface (through PhysFS, quarantined in its own way aside from game code)
         - [ ] UI bindings
         - [ ] Input bindings (In a way that doesn't require knowing what the input system is)
         - [ ] Sound-System bindings
         - [ ] Entity System bindings (Allowing for custom entities)
         - [ ] World bindings (Allowing for custom generators, dimensions, etc)
         - [ ] Generally anything allowing for fully custom games with no compiled code
 - [ ] Input (ordered by priority)
     - [x] Mouse & Keyboard
     - [ ] Joystick
     - [ ] Gamepad
     - [ ] Touchscreen
     - [ ] Wii Remote & Nunchuck (Yes, Really)
 - [ ] Physics
     - [ ] Quake-style physics
     - [ ] 'Realistic' physics
 - [ ] Neat non-essentials
     - [ ] Sub-Worlds (portions of the world that move on their own, can be scaled etc. and still function like normal)
     - [ ] Variable gravity (I.e walking on walls, spherical worlds, etc.)
     - [ ] Dynamic lighting
        - [ ] Dynamic shadows
     - [ ] Source:tm:-like particle system
